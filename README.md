# Maximum and Minimum Factorization Lengths in Numerical Semigroups

The code in this file is used to supplement the [numerical semigroup sage package](https://github.com/coneill-math/numsgps-sage) with functions that can be used to calculate the minimum and maximum factorization length for an element in a numerical semigroup without need to calculate the actual length set. 

For a complete set of functions surrounding the structure theorem for sets of length for numerical semigroups, please use the [Python numerical semigroup package](https://github.com/gilad-moskowitz/numericalSemigroupPackage) I created.
